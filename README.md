Kefir After Install Tools for Ubuntu and Linux Mint
===================================================

Automated installation a lot of useful extra software on Ubuntu after the initial desktop install. 

This program installs a collection of some of the best Ubuntu software and can be considered to be one of the top things to do after installing Ubuntu.


Selecting and Installing all the extra software on a new Ubuntu computer can be time consuming. I wanted to automate the process on new machines as well as simplify the installation for new users. All comments and improvements are very welcome as this is purely a personal project at this point and must be considered a work in progress.
